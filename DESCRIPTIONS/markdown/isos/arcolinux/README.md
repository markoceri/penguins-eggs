# [ArcoLinux](https://arcolinux.com/)
 
[ArcoLinux](https://arcolinux.com/) is almost a world, I knew its author [Erik Dubois](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJdmdUp5BrsWsYVQUylCMLg) but in truth, being a derivative apparently created by a hobbyist I underestimated it, I'm changing my mind.

Remastering it will be an opportunity to get to know it better and follow Erik's courses, who is always very active.

Following are strange animals, where I used ArcoLinux as base in place of Arch, this is interesting to investigate that we can do!

- **egg-of-arcolinux-naked** just an arcolinuxd-v23.10.01-x86_64.iso remestered;
* **egg-of-arcolinux-colibri** an arcolinuxd-v23.10.01-x86_64.iso remester dressed with colibri (xfce + develop);
* **egg-of-arcolinux-albatros** an arcolinuxd-v23.10.01-x86_64.iso remester dressed with albatros (plasma + develop);

# Installing ArcoLinux Linux via PXE

One feature of ISO images made with eggs is the ability to be used for network installation . All you have to do is boot the ISO to be installed, open a terminal window and type the command: 

```sudo eggs cuckoo```.

Then all you have to do is boot from the network the machines to be installed and start the calamares or krill installer.

You can also perform an unattended installation with krill, see the [manual](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/english) or, find assistance in the [telegram Penguins' eggs](https://t.me/penguins_eggs) group.
